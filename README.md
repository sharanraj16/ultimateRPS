# Ultimate RPS - README

## Project Overview

Welcome to Ultimate RPS! This project is a comprehensive demonstration of my skills as a Full Stack Developer, showcasing my proficiency in front-end and back-end web technologies. Developed as part of my Full Stack Developer course at Code Institute, this game utilizes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to offer an engaging and interactive experience.

Ultimate RPS allows players to challenge the computer in an expanded version of the classic Rock Paper Scissors game, incorporating additional moves like Lizard and Spock. The objective is to reach a score of 10 before the computer does, making it an exciting and competitive experience. This README provides a detailed overview of the project's features, the technologies used, and the criteria met, highlighting the various elements that contribute to the game's functionality and user experience.

### 5. **End Credits**

Acknowledges the contributions of Tech Tamil and Logic First Tamil YouTube channels, which provided valuable resources and guidance throughout development.

## Technologies Used

### 1. **HTML**

HTML forms the structural backbone of the game, including:

- **`<div>` Tags**: For sections like name input, gameplay, scores, results, and modals.
- **`<button>` Tags**: For interactive elements like game controls, theme selection, mute button, and action buttons.
- **`<p>` Tags**: For text such as scores, result messages, and timer.
- **`<input>` Tag**: For the player’s name input field.
- **`<audio>` Tags**: For sound effects and background music.

### 2. **CSS**

CSS styles the game interface for a visually appealing design, including:

- **Body Styling**: Applies a gradient background and centers content. The gradient blends light blue to dark blue and grey to black.
- **Game Card Styling**: Features a dark gradient background with rounded corners and a shadow effect.
- **Button Styling**: Includes vibrant gradients, rounded corners, animations, hover effects, and active states.
- **Modal Styling**: Ensures the modal is prominently displayed with a semi-transparent background and centered content.
- **Theme Styles**: Multiple themes are available, allowing players to customize the game's appearance.

### 3. **JavaScript**

JavaScript adds interactivity and logic to the game, including:

- **Game Initialization**: Manages the player's name input and transitions to the game section.
- **Round Processing**: Handles player moves, generates the computer’s move, determines results, updates scores, and plays sound effects.
- **Timer**: Manages the countdown for each round and updates the display.
- **Game End and Restart**: Manages end-of-game scenarios and resets scores for a new game.
- **Modal Management**: Controls the display of the rules modal and handles clicks outside the modal to close it.
- **Theme Selection**: Allows players to change the theme dynamically.
- **Mute Button**: Toggles sound effects and background music.

### JavaScript Techniques Used

- **Event Handling**: Utilized extensively to manage user interactions. For example, clicking buttons triggers specific functions that handle game actions and state changes.
- **DOM Manipulation**: Key for updating the game interface dynamically. JavaScript is used to update the score, display results, and switch between game states by modifying the DOM elements.
- **Random Number Generation**: Used to simulate the computer’s move in each round. This ensures that the game remains unpredictable and fair.
- **Conditional Statements**: Crucial for determining the outcome of each round. The logic checks the player's move against the computer's move to decide the winner.
- **Functions**: Modular approach to handle various game functionalities, such as starting the game, playing a round, ending the game, and showing/hiding the rules modal.
- **Audio API**: Plays sound effects and background music based on game events, enhancing user experience through audio feedback.
- **Timer**: Uses JavaScript's timing events to create a countdown for each round.
- **Local Storage**: Could be used to store the player’s name, theme selection, or game state to persist data across sessions (though not implemented in the current version).

## Detailed JavaScript Logic

### 1. **Initialization**

The `startGame()` function:
![startpage  image](assets/readmeimages/gamestart.jpg)
- Retrieves and validates the player’s name.
- Displays a welcome message and transitions to the game section.

### 2. **Handling Player Moves**

The `playGame(playerChoice)` function:
![level image](assets/readmeimages/gamelevel.jpg)
![play area image](assets/readmeimages/gamearea.jpg)
- Plays the click sound effect.
- Generates a random computer move.
- Compares moves to determine the round result and updates scores.
- Resets the timer for the next round.
- Checks if the game has ended and calls `endGame()` if necessary.

### 3. **Timer Management**

The `startTimer()` and `resetTimer()` functions:

- `startTimer()`: Initializes and starts the countdown for the round.
- `resetTimer()`: Resets the countdown to the initial value and restarts it for the next round.

### 4. **Ending the Game**

The `endGame(message)` function:
![endgame image](assets/readmeimages/gameend.jpg)
- Hides the game section and displays the game-over section with a result message.
- Provides an option to play again.

### 5. **Restarting the Game**

The `restartGame()` function:

- Resets scores and game state.
- Resets the timer.
- Shows the name input section and hides the game and game-over sections.

### 6. **Managing the Rules Modal**
![gamerules image](assets/readmeimages/gamerule.jpg)

The `showRules()` and `hideRules()` functions:

- `showRules()`: Displays the modal with game rules.
- `hideRules()`: Hides the modal.
- An event listener closes the modal if a user clicks outside of it.

### 7. **Theme Selection**
![gametheme image](assets/readmeimages/gametheme.jpg)
The `changeTheme(theme)` function:

- Applies the selected theme's styles to the game interface.
- Updates the theme dynamically without reloading the page.

### 8. **Mute Button**

The `toggleMute()` function:

- Toggles the background music and sound effects on and off.
- Updates the mute button icon to reflect the current state.

## Meeting Game Criteria

### Pattern Matching Functionality

Pattern matching typically involves recognizing sequences or patterns in the input. In the context of Ultimate RPS, this could mean recognizing specific sequences of moves. If the game tracks or responds to sequences of player moves, it includes pattern matching. For example, if the game responds differently when a player plays "Rock, Paper, Scissors" in that order versus another order, that would be pattern matching.

### A Limited Number of Tries Before the Game is Over

Ultimate RPS has a built-in mechanism to limit the number of tries. The game is set to end when either the player or the computer reaches a score of 10, ensuring that the game has a clear endpoint and does not continue indefinitely.

### A Score Tracking System

The game includes a robust score tracking system. Scores for both the player and the computer are updated in real-time and displayed on the screen. The game continues to update these scores until one side reaches a score of 10.

### The Ability to Play Against the Computer

Ultimate RPS allows players to compete against a computer opponent. The computer makes random moves, and the outcome of each round is determined based on the player's move versus the computer's move, providing an engaging and unpredictable gaming experience.
